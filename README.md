# Chess

I decided to practice by writing the game of chess in Java.


Work in progress!
I have gone back and modified and refactored the code multiple times.
I had originially uploaded this (the first commit) and then worked on it from time to time but didn't keep the repo up-to-date.
I just decided to go back and update the repo, and I'm going to try and keep it up to date with my modifications.


At this point, the game is almost completely finished with the exception of calculating checkmate and end game.
I don't remember what issues are present and I will probably continue to go back and clean up the code.
