# Chess

I decided to practice by writing the game of chess in Java.


Work in progress!
I have gone back and modified and refactored the code multiple times.
I had originially uploaded this (the first commit) and then worked on it from time to time but didn't keep the repo up-to-date.
I decided to go back and update the repo, and I'm going to try and keep it up to date with my modifications.


At this point, the game is almost completely finished with the exception of calculating checkmate and end game.
I will continue to go back and clean up the code.


NOTE: I realize there are simpler ways to write the game engine. My goal is to practice creating different classes and having them interract with each other.
    For example, a piece knowing how it moves and then asking the board if a space is free to move to.
